## 🧠 What Is a War Thunder Aimbot?

A **War Thunder aimbot** calculates enemy speed, direction, armor thickness, and weapon spread in real-time — and then lines up your shots with deadly precision. It’s way more advanced than basic auto-aim.

You’ll snap straight to **weak points**, lead moving jets, and hit ammo racks across the map without doing the math 😎
